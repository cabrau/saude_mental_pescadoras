I also compare with the oil spill, because it was recovering, was beginning to sell things, was improving. when it comes that you have to stop there once, people, it was very difficult, it was very hungry, it was needs. we here only had support from the ong, the prefecture in the period of pandemic, in the month of June began pandemic in March. spent the month of April, came a basic basket donated by her by the cras. by social action, that the cras in social action was donated a basic basket that did not last 15 days for families. during this period that the children were without school, already in the end, now of all, it was that came two basic baskets, very little, because the children had the obligation to have at least the merit. But that didn't happen. the parents were at all loss. I had to take the classes that I had to do with the mereids, that's who had no conditions for his parents. So, the pandemic for us was very difficult. for me I don't even talk, I talk about it for us, because it wasn't easy to live that pandemic. first, at first, very afraid, did not know what it was, there was no information the secretariat here, the secretariat was no longer passing, the hospital much less the health agent, much worse. we were learning what was going out in the media, what came in the media, that's what we were learning. It was a very dark time. You didn't leave the house, I didn't have the courage to go there, Mom, because Mom was older than me. I was afraid to go home. just so you have a notion how hard that was. but then the young people were thinking they could. We still made a containment barrier. we, on our own, made a barrier in the garden below, that this generated a lot of controversy, but we thank that much did not happen at that beginning because of that barrier. Look how that last year had no barrier and it was absurd those, in the period I was intubated, said that here had 100 cases, had 70 cases in one day, do you imagine?"}, {"sentimento": "Neutro", "polaridade": 0.0, "subjetividade": 0.0, "n\u00famero de palavras": 3, "t\u00edtulo": "Jardins 4", "respostas": "practically everyone, then."}, {"sentimento": "Neutro", "polaridade": -0.1, "subjetividade": 0.1, "n\u00famero de palavras": 13, "t\u00edtulo": "Jardins 4", "respostas": "I spent 20 days intubated and 45 interns.
